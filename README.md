# time-arrow
An Android widget tool that helps you stay organized and on track with your daily activities

Displayed as a long vertical rectangular bar with a dynamic arrow, it represents a single day. Color-coded blocks within the bar represent various tasks or activities that you should be doing at specific times throughout the day. As time progresses, the arrow descends, indicating the current time. With this static widget, you can easily visualize your daily routine and ensure that you're staying on schedule.
